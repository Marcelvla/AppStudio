USER GUIDE Friendsr

On the main screen you'll see a number of characters from the TV show Game of Thrones. You can click on these 
to see their profile. On their profile you can give them a rating between 0-5 stars, with steps of 0.5 stars. The 
rating you give the characters will be saved. 

Functionality:
The app Friendsr uses the Friendsadapter to show the different kind of Friend classes there are. The Friend class holds the name, bio and drawable id to show the name, bio and picture of the characters. To show the circular 
portraits I used a library from hdodenhof (https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) and imported a simple version
of the game of thrones font. Friendsadapter puts the friends in a grid_item.xml layout.
