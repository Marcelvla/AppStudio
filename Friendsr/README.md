USER GUIDE Friendsr

On the main screen you'll see a number of characters from the TV show Game of Thrones. You can click on these 
to see their profile. On their profile you can give them a rating between 0-5 stars, with steps of 0.5 stars. The 
rating you give the characters will be saved. 

Functionality:
The app Friendsr uses the Friendsadapter to show the different kind of Friend classes there are. To show the circular 
portraits I used a library from hdodenhof (https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) and imported a simple version
of the game of thrones font. Friendsadapter puts the friends in a grid_item.xml layout.
